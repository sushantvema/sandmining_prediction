    "I picked a pytorch implementation of Unet for this semantic segmentation task for the following reasons. It's architectural features allow it to handle multi-class segmentation with ease, be robust to variations in image size and content, be effective for limited training data scenarios, and versatile for a variety of segmentation tasks. \n",

    "The encoder and decoder structures (downsampling and upsampling paths) allow the model to extract high level information about image content and to synthesize low level features with decoder features for better localization. This is paired with skip connections which help preserve boundary information and enhance localization accuracy. It also helps with training by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. Lastly, fully convolutional layers in conjunction with the encoder decoder architecture allow for pixel-wise segmentation and context aggregation. \n",
